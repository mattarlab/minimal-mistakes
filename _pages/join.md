Understanding the brain and mind is an interdisciplinary challenge. Thus, our lab is always looking for outstanding graduate students and postdocs with a wide variety of interests and expertise, including Cognitive Science, Neuroscience, Psychology, Computer Science, Engineering, Statistics, and others. We are also open to people interested in either modeling/theory and experiments (or both).

The ideal applicant should be fluent in some programming language and have knowledge of probability and statistics, linear algebra, machine learning, and reinforcement learning. If you fit that description and think our lab is the right fit for you, send an email to [Marcelo Mattar](mailto:mmattar@ucsd.edu "Marcelo Mattar"). 

**Note:** _We believe that our science is better with a diverse team. We embrace and encourage our lab membersâ€™ differences in age, color, disability, ethnicity, family or marital status, gender identity or expression, language, national origin, ability, political affiliation, race, religion, sexual orientation, socio-economic status, veteran status, and other characteristics that make our lab members who they are._
