Understanding the brain and mind is an interdisciplinary challenge. Thus, our lab is always looking for graduate students and postdocs with a wide variety of interests and expertise, including 
Cognitive Science, Neuroscience, Psychology, Computer Science, Engineering, Statistics, and others. 

Applicants should be fluent in some programming language and have knowledge of probability and statistics, linear algebra, machine learning, and reinforcement learning.

We believe that our science is better with a diverse team. We embrace and encourage our lab membersâ€™ differences in age, color, disability, ethnicity, family or marital status, gender identity or expression, language, national origin, ability, political affiliation, race, religion, sexual orientation, socio-economic status, veteran status, and other characteristics that make our lab members who they are.
